One such area is the evaluation and ranking of complex documents. This presentation will explore how leveraging open-source tools like pdf2txt, GPT summarization, and Azure OpenAI Service can help organizations automate and optimize their document evaluation processes while maintaining anonymity and confidentiality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will demonstrate a three-level approach that combines the power of GPT models with human evaluation criteria, allowing organizations to efficiently analyze and rank documents based on their relevance and quality:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Basic Matching and Ranking: In this level, we will use pdf2txt for document extraction and GPT models to match description criteria with items. The system will then rank the items based on their relevance, providing a basic analysis of the documents.</li>\r\n\t<li>Incorporating Human Evaluation Criteria: Building on the basic matching and ranking, we will introduce human evaluation criteria that guide the GPT models in their analysis. This approach allows for a more nuanced and human-like understanding of the documents, enabling more accurate and meaningful ranking.</li>\r\n\t<li>GPT Model Fine-tuning with Human-ranked Samples: In the final level, we will provide the GPT models with samples of ranked items evaluated by human experts. The models will learn from these samples and fine-tune their ranking capabilities. Once trained, the GPT models can then be applied to new sets of documents, resulting in a more accurate and efficient ranking process that closely mirrors human judgment.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>This presentation will showcase how the combination of open-source technologies and innovative approaches can help organizations accelerate their operations and improve decision-making.

The experiments will explore Python and other programming languages, and using Rust within existing projects written in these languages.</p>\r\n",venue:{name:s,weight:0},language:d,language_sym_interp:[],level:c,speakers:[{name:"Utkarsh Goel",community:"Clearbot(Cofounder, CTO)",country:o,description:"<p>Utkarsh has been in Hong Kong since 2016, and graduated from the University of Hong Kong with a degree in Computer Science in 2020.
